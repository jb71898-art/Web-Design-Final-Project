    <section id="Lifes">
    <p>I was born April of 2007 in Savannah Georgia. I've lived in Savannah all my life and
        graduated from New Hampstead High School. As a kid I played soccer, football,
        and basketball. During my senior year I dual enrolled for a 2 semester with
        Georgia Southern. Ive had a love for video games all my life and at 14 I built my first
        gaming PC. Ever since then my love for electronics and computers has grow exponentially.
        I plan on staying at Georgia Southern for the rest of the Fall 2025 semester the going to
        the Air Force National Guard where I plan to pursue a job in Cyber Security. </p>
